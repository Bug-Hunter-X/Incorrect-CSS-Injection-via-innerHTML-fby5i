# Incorrect CSS Injection via innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where an attempt is made to inject CSS styles into an element's innerHTML to modify its appearance. This approach is incorrect and often leads to unexpected behavior or no changes at all. The solution shows the correct way to modify CSS, using JavaScript to target the element's style property or using a separate stylesheet.
